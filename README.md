# Statistical Learning - Exam 2
This was a project completed as a part of Stat764, statistical learning, with the goal of developing an algorithm to correctly predict whether a flight out of New York will be delayed and with what severity. This project combines data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and data modeling into a comprehensive function that can be applied to multiple data sets. This project was focused on stacking learning models to train and test data, and make final predictions. All work was completed in Python programming language.

### Data
The data used for this project consists of several csv files containing information regarding airports, flight details, and weather, where each observation represents a unique flight.
