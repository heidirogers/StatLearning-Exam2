# Statistical Learning - Exam 2
This was a project completed as a part of Stat764, statistical learning, with the goal of developing an algorithm to correctly predict whether a flight out of New York will be delayed and with what severity. This project combines data cleaning and exploratory analysis with predictive modeling into a comprehensive function that can be applied to other data sets. A large focus of this process was on feature engineering and stacking different learning models to generate final predictions with the best accuracy. All work was completed in Python programming language.

### Data
The data used for this project consists of several csv files containing information regarding airports, flight details, and weather, where each observation represents a unique flight.
